    <h1>The Curiosities</h1>
    <sub>by Susan Gloss (Goodreads Author)</sub>
    <p>
      The follow-up to Susan Gloss’s successful debut, Vintage, is a
      charming mid-western story of artists, inspiration, and how to
      reinvent your life with purpose and flair
      <br><br>
      Nell Parker has a PhD in Art History, a loving husband named Josh,
      and a Craftsman bungalow in Madison, WI. But her last pregnancy
      ended later in the second trimester, and rather than pausing to grieve,
       she pushes harder for testing and fertility treatments.
       Urging Nell to apply for jobs, Josh believes his wife needs something
       else to focus on other than a baby that may never be.
       <br><br>
       Finding a job turns out to be difficult for an art historian . . .
       until Nell sees the ad seeking a director for a new nonprofit called
       the Mansion Hill Artists’ Colony. The colony is the brainchild of the
       late, unconventional society dame Betsy Barrett, who left
      behind her vast fortune and a killer collection of modern art to
      establish an artist-in-residency program to be run out of her lakeside
      mansion. The executor of Betsy’s estate simply hands Nell a set of house
      keys and wishes her luck.
      <br><br>
      Nell dives into the new role and discovers that while finding artists to
      fill the three residency slots is easy, managing their eccentric
      personalities is not. There’s Odin, a young metal sculptor,
      who keeps the other residents awake with his late-night welding projects.
      And Annie, a dreadlocked granny known for her gritty photography,
      whom Nell is almost certain is dealing pot out of the basement “studio.”
      Lastly, Paige, an art student from the university, takes up residence in
      the third-floor turret, experimenting with new printing and design
      techniques, as well as leading a string of bad boyfriends upstairs
      when she stumbles home late at night.
      <br><br>
      Despite all the drama, Nell finds something akin to a family among the
      members of the creative community that she’s brought together.
      And when her attraction to Odin begins to heat up, Nell is forced to
      decide what will bring her greater joy—the creative, inspired world she’s
      created, or the familiar but increasingly fragile one of her marriage.

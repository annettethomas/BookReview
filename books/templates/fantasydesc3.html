    <h1>Black Leopard, Red Wolf</h1>

    <p>
      Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: "He has a nose,"
      people say. Engaged to track down a mysterious boy who disappeared three
      years earlier, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when
      he finds himself part of a group that comes together to search for the
      boy. The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets
      of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard.
      <br><br>
      As Tracker follows the boy's scent—from one ancient city to another;
      into dense forests and across deep rivers—he and the band are set upon
      by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive,
      Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been
      missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from
      finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is
      telling the truth, and who is lying?
      <br><br>
      Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination,
      Marlon James has written a saga of breathtaking adventure that's also an
      ambitious, involving read. Defying categorization and full of
      unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf is both surprising and
      profound as it explores the fundamentals of truths, the limits of power,
      the excesses of ambition, and our need to understand them all.
